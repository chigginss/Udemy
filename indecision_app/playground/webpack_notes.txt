// notes on webpack


Webpack: What is it? a module bundler? 
we do not want all our code in one file. Break it up so it easier to scale and test

First advantage: organize jS to single file 
file is called bundle -  contains everything 
only need one script tag 
making a lot of requests before app even runs
// grab the add function from add.js
// breaking components into its own file 
// grab react from the react npm module - grab 3rd party directories
// manage dependinces in package.json
// server render and form submissions
// client size js would be effects

// client side 
// split public up > public (index.html, bundle.js)> src(app.js, utils.js)> node_modules(react.js, react-dom.js)
